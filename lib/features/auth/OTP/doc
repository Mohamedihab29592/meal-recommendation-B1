OTP Verification System Document

Overview
The OTP verification feature allows users to sign in with their email, password, and phone number, ensuring their phone
number is valid via OTP verification. The authentication process leverages Firebase for phone number verification and
OTP handling, with Bloc used to manage the state of the authentication flow in the presentation layer.

Features
   1- Verify Number: Users sign in using email, password, and phone number. Firebase validates the phone number through OTP.
   2- OTP Handling: An OTP is sent to the provided phone number. The user then enters the OTP, which is verified. Upon successful
      verification, the user is navigated to the home screen; otherwise, an error message is shown.

# data layer
- data source
  Uses Firebase as a remote data source for phone authentication.
  1- verifyPhoneNumber: Initiates phone number verification through Firebase.
  2- signInWithCredential: Authenticates the user with the OTP provided.
- network
  Contains error handling for Firebase-specific exceptions.
  1-handleSignInWithCredentialException: Handles errors encountered during OTP verification.
  2-handleFirebasePhoneException: Manages exceptions during phone number verification.
- repository
  Interfaces with Firebase to handle phone number verification and OTP submission.

# domain layer
- entities
  PhoneNumberEntities: Contains the data needed for Firebase to initiate the phone verification process,
  including:
  1-phoneNumber: The user's phone number.
  2-codeAutoRetrievalTimeout, codeSent, verificationCompleted, verificationFailed: Callbacks for handling the different
  phases of phone verification.

- useCase
  Each core function in phone authentication has its own use case, providing a single responsibility for each operation:
  1-PhoneAuthenticationUseCase: Triggers Firebase phone verification.
  2-SubmitOTPUseCase: Verifies the OTP entered by the user.

# presentation layer
- controller
  Bloc (PhoneAuthBloc): Manages the state of the phone authentication process. It handles events such as submitting
  the phone number and OTP verification, along with Firebaseâ€™s phone verification callbacks.

- screens
  OTPScreen: UI where users enter the OTP sent to their phone. This screen listens to PhoneAuthBloc states
  to update the UI based on the verification process.
